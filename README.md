# Sentiment-Analysis

In this project I utilized python libraries such as nltk, sklearn, keras, and more to create a LSTM model to perform a sentiment analysis on product reviews. An important aspect was to preprocess the imported training data and use word embeddings to prepare the data to be fed into the designed LSTM model and used to train it.
